What are these timestamps anyway?

Timestamps are an optional addition to the TCP layer to provide information on round-trip times and to help with sequencing – see RFC 1323. The side-e
ffect of supporting TCP timestamps (I’ll drop the IP now) is that in certain situations the uptime of the server can be estimated. The most likely imp
act of this is that an attacker could try to determine the host’s patch status as certain updates require a reboot
