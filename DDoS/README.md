##Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)


####Mitigation

* In order to remove the Mirai malware from an infected IoT device, users and administrators should take the following actions:
  
  - Disconnect device from the network.
  - While disconnected from the network and Internet, perform a reboot. Because Mirai malware exists in dynamic memory, rebooting the device clears the malware [8].
  - Ensure that the password for accessing the device has been changed from the default password to a strong password. See US-CERT Tip Choosing and Protecting Passwords for more information.
  - You should reconnect to the network only after rebooting and changing the password. If you reconnect before changing the password, the device could be quickly reinfected with the Mirai malware.

####Preventive Steps

* In order to prevent a malware infection on an IoT device, users and administrators should take following precautions:

  - Ensure all default passwords are changed to strong passwords. Default usernames and passwords for most devices can easily be found on the Internet, making devices with default passwords extremely vulnerable.
  - Update IoT devices with security patches as soon as patches become available.
  - Disable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) on routers unless absolutely necessary.[9]
  - Purchase IoT devices from companies with a reputation for providing secure devices.
  - Consumers should be aware of the capabilities of the devices and appliances installed in their homes and businesses. If a device comes with a default password or an open Wi-Fi connection, consumers should change the password and only allow it to operate on a home network with a secured Wi-Fi router.
  - Understand the capabilities of any medical devices intended for at-home use. If the device transmits data or can be operated remotely, it has the potential to be infected.
